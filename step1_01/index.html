    <h1>4th of July Baked Beans</h1>
    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>It's great how a single meal can take you back dozens of years.
      This is one of those recipes that never seems to fail to impress.</p>

    <p>I learned this recipe from the cousin of one of my college friends back in Nashville Tennessee.

      We had an amazing 4th of July feast which included this recipe and some bratwurst
      like these Wisconsin Beer Brats.</p>
